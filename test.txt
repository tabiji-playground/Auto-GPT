from Anders Wallerman

Just ended an Interesting meeting with Esben. I didn't know how tight you and him had been on the app. So i was a bit out of scope to start withüòÇ
But when I understood how much you had involved him it made sense.
My suggestion would be to involve him deeper. Give him and Clem Equity. And formalize the businessplan between the 3 of you. 
I will run to the next meeting now and I will stay in Malm√∂ tonight to meet with Fredrik St√•hle and if you decide to move on the above. Meet up with Clem and Esben tomorrow at 1 to pick Clems brain. 
How is Aslan doing? ‚ù§Ô∏è

to Anders Wallerman

I have already told Giuseppe and you that I have no interest in having OMI further involved than already planned or to have them ‚Äúput their money where their mouth is‚Äù as Giuseppe called it - when he suggested something similar. But thank you for the advise.

I have a meeting planned with Giuseppe this weekend - where we will talk investor opportunities and pitch deck.  

Aslan is doing ok ‚ù§Ô∏è

from Anders Wallerman

I wasn't suggesting Omi, I was suggesting Esben as a person‚ù§Ô∏è

to Anders Wallerman

To me it‚Äôs the same.

from Anders Wallerman

Ok

from Anders Wallerman

It's 100% your decision‚ù§Ô∏è

from Anders Wallerman

I'll cancel the meeting tomorrow then‚òÄÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

to Anders Wallerman

I don‚Äôt understand your sudden focus on Esben as a potential business partner. He is a hired gun - just like Clem - I want them to stay like that. 

Please focus on deciding on a way ahead with OMI as a company - any plan will do as long as there is a plan. And also please move on with getting the company and ownership registered in cooperation with Giuseppe. 

Slick need both to be in order before we can move on with anything - pitch deck and potential investors included.

‚ù§Ô∏è 

from Anders Wallerman

I will call you once i am done with the raging pig and try to explain my thesis‚ù§Ô∏è

to Anders Wallerman

Ok ‚ù§Ô∏è

from Anders Wallerman

Done with the raging pig‚ù§Ô∏è

from Anders Wallerman

Just having some food and then i will look at The Masters on tv before meeting up with Fredrik St√•hle.. ‚ù§Ô∏è

from Anders Wallerman

How is Aslan doing? ‚ù§Ô∏è

from Anders Wallerman

Tried to call you‚ù§Ô∏è

from Anders Wallerman

Hey.. what's up? You can't kill Us because i give recommendations in business.. it's still your decision.. I hope that Aslan is doing ok and you to.. 
we must be able to have different views on stuff right? ‚ù§Ô∏è

to Anders Wallerman

Hey you - did not heat the phone - I dozed off after almost no sleep last night.

Are you hung up with Frederik now or Can I Call you? ‚ù§Ô∏è

from Anders Wallerman

Ok‚ù§Ô∏è was worried that you got angry with me.
I am having a beer with Fredrik. Will not be late though.. 
how is aslan doing? ‚ù§Ô∏è

to Anders Wallerman

Aslan is doing as good as he can considering his situation. ‚ù§Ô∏è

from Anders Wallerman

‚ù§Ô∏è

from Anders Wallerman

That is Not Cool. At all Katja.. having A discussions on alternatives.. should Always be okay. 
You say that you have The Solution. Go ahead! I'll support you. 

from Anders Wallerman

But making Me the enemy? What is okay with that? 

to Anders Wallerman

How did I make you my enemy? I simply try to suggest a way forward differently from yours. And I have a business model we can use for inception. The one you suggest can  be implemented is for the future. 

from Anders Wallerman

Ok, I will rest my case. You have a plan, you should execute on that. 

from Anders Wallerman

You can have Slick in total. As it's "your idea". I suggest we use Guiseppes solution and transform the investments that has been made into loans. That Slick needs to repay. 
And then we start/buy a company tomorrow. That you own. 100%. You then offer me an upside as an investor.. to pay for the bills that needs to be payed now.. ok?

from Anders Wallerman

I have just sent a request to Delphi to help us setup the new company. You will own 100% and the investments we have made so far is suggested to be turned into loans. 
Ok??

to Anders Wallerman

Let‚Äôs get Giuseppe involved in this as planned. 

from Anders Wallerman

No probs. It's your company

from Anders Wallerman

Delphi is involved to execute on the order you gave earlier today. Setting up the company. 
Once that is done it's all yours

from Anders Wallerman

If you feel you need Giuseppe for that. I am all ears.. 

from Anders Wallerman

It's your company?ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

from Anders Wallerman

I really like the "this is mine" mentality. Like you describe. Everything else we share, cats, costs, income. Etc etc.. but  now.. ITS YOURS.. we pay for our bills together, we figure out life together.. but SLick.. thats YOU. 
You are using me Katja.. i am just a concubine like all of your boyfriends. We have done some good though, we sold Oumph, we helped Gita, "you" started Slick.. but seriously.. this is a joke. I can't remember the last occasion when i felt We where important? I can't even remember the last time we had sex.. my bad . Sorry.. i don't turn you on. 
So with that said.. you should find your way. I will invest and support Slick.But today really showed thar We can't work together. Me and G is saying the same thing. And ylu decide to show me a "businessplan" after i have met with Omi.
I Love you.. but this doesn't work

from Anders Wallerman

I was referring to our work-relationship and how you we delt with that. 
I will come home later today to take care of the kids fyi. And now that you publically ended us. What is your plan?

to Anders Wallerman

There are two sick cats at home - I‚Äôm with Leia at the vet right now as she is suffering complications after her surgery. Aslan still have a drain in his jaw - you know I have no plans but to take care of them. 

Since we can‚Äôt even decide on who is breaking up with who - what do you suggests we do?

to Anders Wallerman

And since I obviously have a very hard time reading what you  actually mean in your texts, please clarify what ‚Äúwhat is your plans‚Äù means. Are you asking if I have gym plans or are you asking that because you expect me to leave because ‚Äúyou need to take care of the kids‚Äù? 

from Anders Wallerman

I was trying to understand the situation. 

from Anders Wallerman

I did not break up with you, but as you wrote our lawyer.. i assumed you had plans as you publically ended us. I wanted to let you know that I was coming home to take care of the kids

to Anders Wallerman

And tbh - I thought our work relationship in regards to Slick was long over - you were the one involving Giuseppe as a mediator between us already a month ago. And as far as I know, you were doing the meetings with OMI because you and them needed to figure out a solution in regards to economy versus the MVP product. And now you freak out on me because I remind you to keep focus on why you were doing those meetings in the first place? And you break up our work relationship again? Excuse me for being very confused.

from Anders Wallerman

Well, Iffues is the only investor so far, so obviously there is a need to understand where the app is and where it's going. Esben has made a good impression, and Clem has some ideas that I believe can make onboarding investors much easier.
The business plan needs to be formalized, and much more detailed. Your skiss is a start. I believe Esben and Clem could be of real assistans. But, you are correct. It's not my business and I overstepped in sense of trying to help. I have cancelled the meeting as you know, and Stefan is starting your company and coming back with the legal parts that needs to be adressed in terms of the money that has already been invested. 


to Anders Wallerman

Yes you overstepped and I don‚Äôt think you attitude just explained as ‚Äúan investor‚Äù will do our private life much good‚Ä¶. Also I can‚Äôt really handle you coming back today giving me an attitude in front of the kids - so what do you suggest we do? Do you want me to leave and then you take care of the cats too?

from Anders Wallerman

You are not making this easy Katja. I had/have A sincere and Good intention. What are you actually asking for? It's not help - from me or Gisueppe, that is clear. I understand that. So, then my understanding is that Iffues has only the role as investor? And if so, is it unreasonable that the investor angle in understanding how and in what way the business develops? That has nothing to do woth our private life? 
Or are you actually asking for total freedom to spend all the money we have? And if I don't say yes to that i am a dick? 
I am not bringing any attitude home. You seem to be the angry one.
If you take a step back and look at the situation. Have you got Any reasons to be angry? I gave you a recomendation, and at the same time was very clear that it was just a recomendation. 

from Anders Wallerman

A recomendation that I believe will make it a lot easier to onboard investors..  but, it's an idea, and everybody can have ideas.. so what's the harm?
Me, Gusieppe and Actually also Esben, is very aligned on that the Businessplan is the key.. to push forward. I assume you agree, or if not. Just lead the way and bring in investors so that we can move forward. We are teying to help.. nothing else.. but investing without any clear plan of how to get a return .. thats a tough cookie. 

from Anders Wallerman

I can't take care of the cats as good as you can. You know that. How is Leia doing? Is she ok? 

to Anders Wallerman

Ok. I don‚Äôt know how to even take in what you are saying right now‚Ä¶

Leia got an x-ray today as a big lump has appeared under her scar. They said it‚Äôs fluid and not infection. Ronja also have a small one. Aslan needs his scar cleaned several times a day and  his tube taken out tomorrow or Sunday. They all need medicine once a day. Look at the instructions on the box. Leia and Aslan weighs 4 kg and Ronja 4,5. 

I will take off - when will you arrive?

from Anders Wallerman

Don't take off. I can't handle the cats. So in that case i'll stay here instead.
I am not angry or have an attitude. 

from Anders Wallerman

August will stay at Carolines

to Anders Wallerman

üëçüèª

from Anders Wallerman

Caroline will be going to Stockholm tomorrow, so August will come. I will be back at 7-8‚ù§Ô∏è

from Anders Wallerman

If you don't want me home, me and August can go somewhere fyi. 

from Anders Wallerman

Is that ok? Or I need to make other arrangements‚ù§Ô∏è

to Anders Wallerman

I think you and August should make other arrangements.

from Anders Wallerman

Ok. But is it ok for him to come to Vadstena before i am home? 

to Anders Wallerman

I think you should pick him up at his Mom‚Äôs place. 

from Anders Wallerman

Well, that sets the bar quite clear. Understood

from Anders Wallerman

I need to understand Mollys situation then aswell. Are throwing her out aswell? 
I am driving home as we speak. 

from Anders Wallerman

You

from Anders Wallerman

Can you update me so I can make arrangements? I am obviously cancelling the trip to France. You can treat me in whatever way you want, but the kids should not suffer.. 

to Anders Wallerman

I am not kicking anyone out of here. I just suggested you‚Äôd pick up August at his moms place - that way we can avoid any kids getting stuck in bad energy. 

to Anders Wallerman

Are you driving here now? 

from Anders Wallerman

I need to go home and pickup August tomorrow. Caroline was planning to go to Stockholm but that has been changed. Anton will visit her instead. 
But they are taking off to a concert.
I understand that you don't want to meet me, so i'll figure something out. 
But i need to know about sunday and onwards as Molly has School.

to Anders Wallerman

Ok - I‚Äôm confused - how do you want us to do this? And when are you planning on arriving in Vadstena? 

from Anders Wallerman

1. You don't want to see me - So i can't go home.
2. I need to pickup August tomorrow-and go somewhere
3. I need to understand your plan so o can make plans for Molly.
4. I assume that you are breaking up with me. As you don't want me home.
If so we need a plan on everything. 

from Anders Wallerman

5. You need to obviously cater for the sick cats

from Anders Wallerman

I can't do that..

from Anders Wallerman

You know how to deal with them. 

to Anders Wallerman

Seriously - well done in putting everything on me.

I have no fuxxing plan - the breaking up part is all on you Anders. Again. As usual. So don‚Äôt approach me like I have a roll out plan ready for the break up situation you keep bringing up.

Right now I‚Äôm just trying to keep my shit together and avoid any more conflicts with you. We agreed on not seeing each other this weekend - from there I obviously know as little as you. 

And if it‚Äôs best that you pick up August here tomorrow, fine, do that but don‚Äôt show up with an attitude.

from Anders Wallerman

As i wrote, Caroline changed her plan, she is not going to Stockholm. Wich means i can pick him up at her place in the afternoon. 
As i have said a million times- i have no attitude and i'm not angry. 


to Anders Wallerman

Ok - when will August arrive tomorrow? And when do you pick him up? 

And I will definitely spend the weekend trying to make sense on how everything you said on the phone before you hung up on me and what you wrote afterwards - is you not being angry or having an attitude. I find that very difficult at the moment.

from Anders Wallerman

He is Not coming to Vadstena.. as i have written several times now. Caroline is Not leaving as she planned first. So.. i can pick him up.. in Str√•lsn√§s. You don't need to do anything. 
Separate Slick with us. I made a mistake while talking about the App with Esben. I shouldn't have tried to help. My bad. 

to Anders Wallerman

Ok in regards to August. 

It was obviously hard to naturally assume you were referring to us professionally and not privately, when you throw in your degrading opinion on our sex life, claim that I‚Äôm using you, just like I used all my other boyfriends, that our co existence is a joke and that you can‚Äôt remember when ‚Äúwe‚Äù were last important. To me - that‚Äôs an even bigger joke. I‚Äôm sorry but I seriously do not understand your reasoning here. 

But that‚Äôs not what this is really about, is it? - you are pissed at me for having an opinion different that yours. Again. As usual. This time about a business model. I‚Äôm not really up for having such a shit storms rolling at me for having an opinion - professionally or privately. I feel exactly the same about that shit as I told you at New Years Day. 

And nothing much is really changing - I was hopeful coming back from DR this time. But you have been drunk and rude to me 3 times at home this past week already and now this? How is therapy going and why are you drinking so much at home again - when you know what it does to us? 

from Anders Wallerman

I do appologize for the drinking. The financials are really stressing me at the moment. The fact that FFP might not make it. 
I have the next appointment on thursday.
It's def not that we have 2 different opinions.. I was trying to help. With creating a business-modell.. and map up AI (not have them incorporated) but mapped so that you can claim "tech" on top of all other great values..

to Anders Wallerman

But did you not put in Giuseppe as a mediator between us in regards to Slick a month ago? And did we not agree on that I‚Äôm running the Slick project and if I need your help in other things than planned, I will ask? 

Why did you then disregard all  that and go to a meeting with Esben - where you have an planned agenda in regards to economy and the current planned MVP version - and then suddenly demand to step in and set a whole new plan for shareholder strategy and also a business model that are impossible to integrate in the MVP? Why don‚Äôt you stick to what you had to do instead of this going in a complete other direction with the excuse ‚ÄúI was just trying to help‚Äù? Come on? No wonder working together is hard when you make your own rules all the time? 

from Anders Wallerman

It was Not what happened.. 
we had a very lenghty discussion about the app and what he thought was needed to do. I had No intention going there outside of our scope.
What i understood and learned from the discussion with Esben though sounded smart. That's why I sent the recomendation on the 2 topics. 
No added changes in the MVP was discussed nor suggested.. 
But a clear theoretical map on Navigios personality test in combination with AI solutions (not develop them now) but pitch them for the future seemed smart.. 

to Anders Wallerman

I couldn‚Äôt agree more. I also agreed on that already a year ago. But why offer them shares for something we can buy them to do when the timing is right? I don‚Äôt get the reasoning? 

And what did you agree on then when it comes to the current MVP - how much can we spend, if any? I have been patiently waiting for that information for over a month now! Did you skip that while making all the other plans?

from Anders Wallerman

I'm not conspiring against you. 
Shares would make them have skin in the game, no cost to get the extra job done. You would have an even stronger pitch-deck. And more experience from the app-world . On the inside. That was my reasoning. We came as far as agreeing on the current invoice, and to get tge businessplan ready. But obviously we couldn't/wouldn't take any decisions

to Anders Wallerman

So you have already discussed shares with them? Since you could not / would not take any decisions? 

from Anders Wallerman

No off course not. 
Stop now.. 


from Anders Wallerman

For god sakes..

to Anders Wallerman

Ok - just making sure I don‚Äôt misread anything

to Anders Wallerman

I don‚Äôt see why we can‚Äôt present them as part of the Slick team as consultants - which we already do. And that way still explain to investors how that constellation for a future business model could be of value.

to Anders Wallerman

And did you go through my suggestion of a business model? 

from Anders Wallerman

You can absolutely do that. 
As i have said. It was One suggestion. 
No we did not - i had no computer with me. 
We had a lenghty discussion on all kind of topics and what not. 
And i picked his brain as much as I could to learn and understand. 


from Anders Wallerman

And also learn more anout the company itself with trine etc

to Anders Wallerman

Why could we not have this conversation last night? Why did you have a need to break up with me professionally when I said the same things last night? Why do you come out so calm about everything now? 

from Anders Wallerman

I wanted to have a discussion like this. But read your tone as - very Anti. And I reacted to that. 
I am here to try my best to help. Not dictate or push my strategies on you. But it feels like everything i say is interpret like i'm the most evil person with the worst agenda.. 
i have made it very clear for All people involved that You are in charge and that it is your decisions... on whatever topic we discuss. I made it very clear that my role in the discussion is to help with the first part of financing etc and that i'm only ibterested in learning about the app-world.


from Anders Wallerman

And fyi, the kids have Easter-break for your info.. 

to Anders Wallerman

Well every time I have a different opinion than you, you take it as an attack. Then fights happen and I have to defend all sort of things. Just like now - my tone, what you believe I think and feel - it‚Äôs the same story over and over again. That‚Äôs why we have decided that you run FFP and I run Slick. To avoid these kinds of ‚Äúmisunderstandings‚Äù. I‚Äôm glad you want to help and educate yourself on tech but it‚Äôs not really what is asked of you right now.  

You kick started the company registration last night. Much appreciated.

Now please decide on how much you want to further invest in Slick in regards to marketing and app production - if any. It‚Äôs information I need to put into the pitch deck. It has taken you a month already. 

I am planning to meet online with Giuseppe for further planning of the deck. And then I think Giuseppe should fill you in  the process from there. Hopefully you and I will come back to a point where I feel comfortable talking about Slick with you without being afraid of you ‚Äúmisunderstanding‚Äù me. 

from Anders Wallerman

And we as a family? Why is the decision on how we invest our money just on me? 
Or are we done? 

from Anders Wallerman

It has taken you a month already.. that's unfortunately precisely what I mean, the attitude. On what numbers/plan am i making the decision? What are the projections for future cost/roi/who and who else is going to invest. All of that needs to be answered. And our family finances.. isn't that important for you at all? 
You want to use all the money we have left? 

from Anders Wallerman

In no way am I bringing attitude. It's just questions.
It feels like you make me obligated.. to risc and spend all of our money.. 

from Anders Wallerman

And if I don't .. i am a dick

to Anders Wallerman

Ok - Anders . I will stop the production for Slick and then you can get all the info you need when it‚Äôs ready. 

from Anders Wallerman

Well.. the educational part is necessary. To be a to make a judgement on how to proceed with investments and what not. So i'm sorry, I disagree. I need to have an understanding of risc and reward and what will come next.. 

to Anders Wallerman

Just stop. Let‚Äôs stick to what you told Stephan to do to say and let me know how much Slick owes you. I will find money somewhere else when Slick is ready. 

to Anders Wallerman

There - no reason to discuss that further

from Anders Wallerman

You actually think that my questions are not valid?

Ok. 

to Anders Wallerman

Today*

to Anders Wallerman

I don‚Äôt think we can work together - that has nothing to do with my opinion on your intelligence!

from Anders Wallerman

But you are making me the enemy because i want to understand the businessmodel and because I care for our future economy. To keep a safery net for us. 

from Anders Wallerman

Safety

from Anders Wallerman

G/Esben agrees with me. On the topic that we need a clear understanding on the b-model.. and how the app will make money, how much money the app will need.. 


to Anders Wallerman

I‚Äôm not making you anything or misunderstanding anything.. I respect your opinion. And thanks for the advice about Slick - I assume I can decide if I want to take it or not?


from Anders Wallerman

Do you really suggest that we spend all the money we have at this point? With the risc of us as family having 0 income.. if FFP fails, if our money is gone.. you have no secondary income, Gita has no Income, Anton has no Income, Zina has some.. i won't have an income if FFP fails

to Anders Wallerman

No I don‚Äôt suggest that! 

to Anders Wallerman

You are clearly not listening to me.

from Anders Wallerman

You are acting aggresive. Why? The plan we made and where we started the journey on slick is not the same anymore.
We believed that Live Kindly would have brought us an imense amount of cash, we believed that we would have had more money left in FFP and not being delayed.


from Anders Wallerman

We live in a time where there is a lot of uncertainty.. globally.. 

to Anders Wallerman

I am not suggesting that - so stop going at me about it and tell me I‚Äôm the aggressive one? Do you not hear yourself?

from Anders Wallerman

WHY don't we take that into cosideration, as a couple.


from Anders Wallerman

‚ûú Replying to you, 2022-04-08 21:29:49: ¬´ Ok - Anders . I will stop the production for Slick and then you can get all the info you need when it... ¬ª

This is aggresive.. if you ask me

to Anders Wallerman

I‚Äôm good with you not spending any more money on Slick - so let‚Äôs agree on that 

to Anders Wallerman

Gives us less to ague about 

from Anders Wallerman

i am not spending WE are spending 

from Anders Wallerman

Are we a Family or Not? 

from Anders Wallerman

Ok

from Anders Wallerman

You say that we shouldn't spend all the money we have - and in the next sentence you say.. OK Anders .. I will stop production.. like the 2 things are not related? 

from Anders Wallerman

And making that into - i an not supporting.. and i'm the dick.. 

from Anders Wallerman

Am

to Anders Wallerman

We we we - yet you ‚Äúbroke up our work relationship‚Äù last night. Or did I misunderstand? Which relationship is it that you broke up? Cus now I really don‚Äôt understand all the we talk when it comes to work??

from Anders Wallerman

Arent you a part of our family? And if we are going to spend our family money on whatever project.. isn't that family-we..? 

from Anders Wallerman

Or have you got some magic trick that can spend our family money on Slick withiut risc? 

from Anders Wallerman

We don't/shall not work togehter.. i agree.. but if we are going to be a family.. you must reason with yourself.. 

from Anders Wallerman

IF we go with your slick-plan.. we have only the hopes of Live kindly to fall back on.. but if things doesn't work. We are broke.. 

to Anders Wallerman

I would like to end this discussion now. As I said - I‚Äôm good with you/us not investing more in Slick - I‚Äôm sure I will find an investor pretty soon. 

from Anders Wallerman

Fine - then we agree

from Anders Wallerman

They are calling from Mollys fotball team.. is she still at home?

from Anders Wallerman

She is not answeringü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

to Anders Wallerman

Yes - just checked.

to Anders Wallerman

She did mention she had a match but not when‚Ä¶. My bad, I should have checked up on it. Ask the football coach if I can drive her somewhere‚Ä¶ 

to Anders Wallerman

Molly says today is just practice‚Ä¶

from Anders Wallerman

Ok‚òÄÔ∏è 

from Anders Wallerman

But it's still sn organized gameü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚òÄÔ∏èüíö

to Anders Wallerman

üëçüèª

from Anders Wallerman

How is Aslan & Leia doing? Are they recovering? 

to Anders Wallerman

Leis is still swollen - it‚Äôs the size of a small lemon - so is Ronja but it is nut size. They are on pain medicine daily. Scars are healing well tho. Aslan is better but the drain needs to go. The vet said I could take it out myself. There are stitches in two places I need to cut in or see to do it. Plan is to do it when he takes his heavy nap during this afternoon. If I fail I will drive him to the vet directly.

to Anders Wallerman

What are your plans? 

to Anders Wallerman
from Anders Wallerman

Ok.. 
so not really over the hill yet?I'm on my way to pickup August. 
Poor cat.. 

from Anders Wallerman

Cats

to Anders Wallerman

He is in good spirit but yes - poor cats.

from Anders Wallerman

Have you made plans? 

to Anders Wallerman

I‚Äôm here on stand by for Aslan.

from Anders Wallerman

Me and August will go eat and to the movies, and then sleep in Lkpg. I have talked to Molly. 
Did you suceed in helping Aslan? 

to Anders Wallerman

Ok. Just tried to get close to Ashland while he sleeps and look at it. But I need Gita to hold the light while I do it and she‚Äôs not here - she‚Äôs home and at Coop. So I will try later. 

to Anders Wallerman

Aslan*

from Anders Wallerman

Ok.. when does the hospital close? If something isn't right? 

from Anders Wallerman

And you need to go.. 


to Anders Wallerman

I can get the top one - and that‚Äôs no problem‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs the one at the opening that can be a problem‚Ä¶. But if I only get the top one I go tomorrow morning.

from Anders Wallerman

If

from Anders Wallerman

Same hospital as before?
Let me know if you need me to call.
We are going to bed now. August is already sleeping and the room is SupersmallüòÇ‚ù§Ô∏è No rooms at all almost available in Link√∂ping. Some Youth-cup of some kind.

from Anders Wallerman

Morning..

We have just had breakfast and are discussing what to do.
We talked about going down to check the boat, but we can't get in to the boat-house as it seems.
I don't know how you feel about us coming home.. 


from Anders Wallerman

How are the cats doing? Is leia better? ‚ù§Ô∏è

to Anders Wallerman

I need to get Gita up and ready for leaving in 2 hours‚Ä¶. 

to Anders Wallerman

Aslan has is still out from this morning - waiting for him atm

from Anders Wallerman

Ok. Should I read that as you don't want to meet me at all? 


from Anders Wallerman

Is Gita sleeping in Augusts room? 

to Anders Wallerman

No - read it as I wrote - I need to get Gita up and then We leave in two hours from now. She has slept in my side of the bed‚Ä¶. 

from Anders Wallerman

Just trying to not misunderstand‚ù§Ô∏è

to Anders Wallerman

When are you here then?

from Anders Wallerman

We are in no rush. August wants to go home. We are waiting for Anton to wake up as he is Link√∂ping.. but that might take a while. August wants to meet him.


to Anders Wallerman

And I would apreciate as little People around us when you get here cus I do need to talk to you. WE need to talk. So if I at least Can have Gita out of here before you arrive. 

from Anders Wallerman

Then we should go somewhere. 
If you have decided we are over - then there is no direct rush. More practical stuff around cats/kids/apartment etc. 

from Anders Wallerman

Read that in a nice way. The kids are off school. Other then Molly that needs to go tomorrow.. she has extra-classes to attend to.

to Anders Wallerman

This is EXACTELY what is fuxxing wrong with us. I said I want to talk!!! You then decide that you Think I want to talk about and act on that. Please stop telling yourself that you can read minds!!!!

from Anders Wallerman

I was trying to be practical Katja.. as cats are sick/kids all over the place.. 

to Anders Wallerman

Great! 

from Anders Wallerman

I can't read minds.. i'm trying to make things easier.. and less stress-ful.. 

to Anders Wallerman

By making new plans and assuming I‚Äôm breaking up with you! 

to Anders Wallerman

You are fuxxing impossible

to Anders Wallerman

And I don‚Äôt want to fight. 

to Anders Wallerman

When are you here

from Anders Wallerman

I don't want to fight either.. i'm super-tired.. 
I ment that YOU and I could go somewhere and talk.. to not create new misunderstandings

from Anders Wallerman

Texting sucks big time.. 

to Anders Wallerman

I‚Äôm starting to think you actually want me to break up with you. You have a fuxxing constant focus on that and you actually were the one that broke up the last time - but ‚Äúprofessionally‚Äù. So what the fuck is this? You don‚Äôt have the balls to do it yourself and therefor you ouch me to do it? 

to Anders Wallerman

Push*

from Anders Wallerman

It's creating the opposite reaction to what i want feel and want to send over to you

from Anders Wallerman

No Katja.. i really don't want us to break up.. 

to Anders Wallerman

This is not doing us any good - IM FUXXING exhausted from defending me self all the time towards your fuxxing imagination and feelings. 

from Anders Wallerman

Let's stop texting because it's just creating a bigger shit-storm. There is No bad intention here.. i just wanted to come home and hug you, talk - thats all

to Anders Wallerman

And I‚Äôm not even out of bed and I‚Äôm crying! So yes please - let‚Äôs stop texting

from Anders Wallerman

The total opposite happens.. makes me supersad.. because it's the opposite of my intention‚ù§Ô∏è Im an really really NoT trying to make things worse.. 

I can't get ahold of Caroline.. she is not picking up. So I'll take August somewhere.. and then go home later. I will try to arrange so he can be with Caroline..

from Anders Wallerman

You can tell Gita that i will be home tomorrow at 7pm, if the cat's need food she can give them during the day.

from Anders Wallerman

Suite booked for you

from Anders Wallerman

Check your email

to Anders Wallerman

Thanks for the booking. I really appreciate it.

I would like to go to DK without any bad energy - I think you and I need a proper talk - to work things out in a good way - but tbh I don‚Äôt see it as something we should do while being on the road with other people. I would like to do that when we are both home.

from Anders Wallerman

A proper talk about what? Speek freely Katja.. 
You need to fix the cats with Gita, I need to sleep at night and can't wait up for them until 2pm.. other then that, have fun, and good luck with the meeting

from Anders Wallerman

I will transfer money to you, but leave my card at home. As we don't know how long you will be gone.. 

to Anders Wallerman

A good talk would be about exactly the attitude you just now in your last two texts brought the table. It‚Äôs totally rude and uncalled for. 

from Anders Wallerman

No, Katja, there is No attitude there.. You don't have a card blanche to spend our money/invest our private money.. Respect that. That calls for a #team, something we haven't been for a long time. You are running your own show as an entreprenur now. But you are spending our private money. My money. And you have told me in the last communication.. that i would perhaps have a few % or actually the last time.. 0. 
So I am investing, but with No return? You can run the show.. be the boss. But why should I invest? 
You paid for everything on your small "girls"trip yesterday. Business? Probably.. but Your business right? Not our business.. that was 15'. 
tomorrow you are going to denmark having fun for 2 days and doing some work.. what will the bill be? 12000 for the hotel so far. You paying for all the rest.. with my card. And what is my return of investment?

to Anders Wallerman
from Anders Wallerman

I will call him

from Anders Wallerman

I have talked to him.. They have bought/tested drugs.. all of them

from Anders Wallerman

Can you please check with Gita if she can stay with the cats/Molly tonight.. I will go home tomorrow lunch to have a sitdown with Molly.. I need some rest to handle that good, if she can't, I will obviously drive home..

from Anders Wallerman

Can you check with Gita if it is ok for her to stay until tomorrow?

to Anders Wallerman

Yes!

to Anders Wallerman

Done now! So happy to realise that I have nothing, own nothing and have no rights in the economy I was told to rely on! That‚Äôs a lot partner! Enjoy your fuxxing weekend. 

from Anders Wallerman

Well, FFP is probably going bankrupt, our only source of income. As our other plans are insecure at current state globally. I do mind our cashflow short and long term. Eventhough things might work out fine, i think it's our responsiblity towards all parts of our family to update are means and spending accordingly to reality. I asked for your idea of spending.. as the money we have is the money we have. 
Hopefully your plan for Slick or other things will bring in cash. You are the one being rude by not even allowing us to talk about financials/spendings/investment/burnrate etc. You have an awesome weekend to. Thanks for being a fuxxing awesome partnerüëä when things get rough

Let me know when you are returning the car.. ‚Äù

from Anders Wallerman
to Anders Wallerman
to Anders Wallerman

Good evening too you too. Zina says hi. 

from Anders Wallerman

When are you returning the car? 

from Anders Wallerman

Its sold

to Anders Wallerman

So, my plan was to drive back today but after yesterdays events I have found it really hard to motivate myself to get on the road. 

It‚Äôs hard for me to understand how me doing normal things, - such as on a Saturday buying some underwear at my daughters store and taking her to a concert at night - can lead to a situation where I‚Äôm accused of not giving a fuck about my relationship and punished by being told my car is sold and to be handed over immediately. 

This situation is like so many other, a result of an unfair investigation process you have constantly going on - hence you tracking the car, and what not. There is absolutely nothing that can convince me that you trust me for a second and as I have told you several times already, I don‚Äôt want to spend my life with someone who thinks that kind of attitude towards a life partner is reasonable. 

It‚Äôs obvious that atm you think that there is nothing wrong with how you often disrespect me, talk down to me, investigate me, generally just distrust me and punish me for things I have never even done. I have told you for a while to be open to challenge that mindset of yours in therapy but you have apparently also lately decided not to invest much in the therapy you otherwise said you had committed to. 

So by all means Anders - no, I should of course not try to ‚Äúchange you‚Äù. And no one is holding a gun to your head but then I have to say that I see a difficult road ahead of us. I don‚Äôt want to live like this. It‚Äôs too hard - for all involved. 

No matter where we go from here because the solution is of course not just to strip me of all recourses and put me on the street with 4 cats, then we got a shared responsibility at home. 

I think for now you should let me know when you are home and then I will find a place to stay. And then when you are away I can be at home. I think that could be a short term solution until things have calmed down between us. I would like to be able to have some conversations with you without feeling my whole life is on the line for something I did not do.

So can we just do that for now and then aim for a sit down soon and talk like adults?

from Anders Wallerman

I sent a short and calm respons to your email. To long to text. 

to Anders Wallerman

Thanks for your response. I do not understand your reasoning at all so let‚Äôs move on with a break up. I will reach out to Stefan tomorrow.

from Anders Wallerman

What is Stefan supposed to be doing? 

from Anders Wallerman

Other then Slick? 

from Anders Wallerman

As he is a business-lawyer. Not a family lawyer.. 

from Anders Wallerman

Thank you for being straight-forward though - let's handle it as smoothly and calm as we can. That will at least be my position. 

to Anders Wallerman

I agree. I would like to drop by on Tuesday as I need some stuff from home. When can I go?

from Anders Wallerman

I will be home during the afternoon, with Guiseppe.
Do you hate me so much that you can't even see me? 
There will be no drama from my side. 

to Anders Wallerman

I don‚Äôt hate you - that‚Äôs another of your ridiculous illusions about who I am and what I feel -  I just don‚Äôt know what to expect when I see you and I was trying to give you some space, that‚Äôs all. But it‚Äôs fine - I will drop by after some things Tuesday.

from Anders Wallerman

I was a matter of speach.. 
I am very sad, but calm. I have no issues with you. But off course. It breaks my heart that we couldn't make it. 


from Anders Wallerman

It

to Anders Wallerman

Ok - but never the less I also need some kind of regular access to Lastk√∂pingsgatan during this break up - it is still my home. I would appreciate it if we could arrange for when I can have some days there too. 

from Anders Wallerman

We need to plan. 
I am i no way shutting you out so don't worry about that
Molly situation is though making it a bit more complicated as to I want to be close to superwize/support her. 
We'll just have to make it work some how.
And also with Gitas apartment etc.
A lot of practical stuff.


to Anders Wallerman

I don‚Äôt think you are so sad - you had already deleted me on Social media days ago - so I think this is exactly what you want. But I agree - let‚Äôs do this respectfully to all involved.

from Anders Wallerman

Not the case. I have felt for some months that we hve been slipping further and further away. 
I just felt sad for not being a part of our life.. so seeing you living life (no pun intended) just hurt me as we where not in a good place. I was sad for us not putting us as a priority and spending time. 
I had hopes after the domenican .. 
I am having dinner and talks with the kids. They are sad to.

to Anders Wallerman

Let me remind you who just spent most of the Easter playing golf - while I sat at home taking care of our home and your kids. Which is pretty much the standard situation when we are at home. So please don‚Äôt give me that bullshit about not me not prioritising us/family - I have spent more time at home with your kids than you and Caroline combined the last year. The sad truth is that you get angry every time I do something you are not the focus of or can control - hence you again excusing your behaviour with being sad that you and family were not prioritised. It‚Äôs just bullshit - all of this has happened before and is a clear pattern which you apparently is the only one who can‚Äôt see. 

Please remind yourself that this breakup is not just about finding a solution for you and Molly. I also live in that home and so does the cats. Just telling me that you need our home cus of the situation with Molly is also just manipulation. You could not even be bothered to go home to the parent meeting about the whole situation and now you need our home and indefinite time to be a dad for her? 

I suggest next week is my turn to be in the home for a week and the. You find somewhere else to stay. And then we take turns like that until both have a solution for what to do. I‚Äôm very sure Molly is ok with that. 

from Anders Wallerman

Wauw

from Anders Wallerman

Let's find you a place instead. So you and the cats have somewhere to go? 


to Anders Wallerman

I would like a family lawyer to help us with practicalities like that. I have asked for a fair short term solution and that is most definitely not to be kicked out on my home over night. 

from Anders Wallerman

?

from Anders Wallerman

Who has kicked you out? 


from Anders Wallerman

You have told me what to do and how. 

to Anders Wallerman

Omg Anders. 

to Anders Wallerman

You really are all about mind games huh? Wau!!

from Anders Wallerman

?

from Anders Wallerman

You are more then welcome to come home. 

to Anders Wallerman

Come home to what? 

from Anders Wallerman

Your home? 

to Anders Wallerman

But our relationship is over and we need to somewhat share that home for some time without being in it at the same time. I‚Äôm sure you understand that, right? And that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm asking for some planning for.


from Anders Wallerman

You have ended our relationship and you can't stand having me around. You are more then welcome to stay here at home.
Or in Gitas old room. 


to Anders Wallerman

Why don‚Äôt we look at solutions that could work for you too - I‚Äôm pretty sure you don‚Äôt want to move up in Gitas old room? And if you do - be my guest - perhaps the cats won‚Äôt be such a big problem for you up there? 

from Anders Wallerman

Well.. you are leaving me .. not the other way around?


to Anders Wallerman

And Anders - I have not alone ended our relationship - you managed to do that on your own every time you did not feel prioritised and let crazy paranoid illusions take over - but I guess you can‚Äôt see that. And this ‚Äúnot my problem‚Äù attitude just really shows your true colours huh? I never really was your problem, I was just convenient. You said it so loud a long time ago‚Ä¶. I should have listened back then. 

to Anders Wallerman

I‚Äôll have Stefan suggest a family lawyer for us. Then you can let that person know when I have access to my home without your presence. That is after all a legal right I have. 

from Anders Wallerman

Calm and respectful.. wasn't that the idea? 

to Anders Wallerman

Getting us any results you think?

from Anders Wallerman

Getting You the Result You want.. isn't that what you mean? 

from Anders Wallerman

You have acess to the apartment

to Anders Wallerman

I need access to our apartment without you in it too - just like you get this week. When can I get that in return? Or is that too much to ask? 

from Anders Wallerman

Let's get your things moved. And let's make that the priority. I will help you get a new place, if I can. We can have some people here packing up your stuff so it's ready to be moved once you find your new place.. 

from Anders Wallerman

Can you also stop on the way back and empty Gitas storage in Malm√∂? I have asked her landlord to transfer the lease to her directly, and he was fine with that. 

to Anders Wallerman

All of this is what I want a family lawyer to help us with. 

from Anders Wallerman

Ok. While you get your lawyer, i will pack up your stuff/furniture. And you just let me know where to send it

to Anders Wallerman

You can‚Äôt just kick me out on some solution you create on your own. Let‚Äôs deal with all practical and financial stuff with a fair family lawyer who have all parties involved at interest. 

Again - as a short term solution - can I have the apartment next week? I will of course take care of Molly but I really need some time at home too. 

from Anders Wallerman

Once again.. i'm Not kicking you out.. you have decided to leave.
You have your stuff here, some furniture, I will help you get a new place, if I can. I reccon you are moving back to Denmark so the deposit should be considered. What else is there to take care of?
Gitas place, you returning the car, Slick-debt. 

from Anders Wallerman

I will ask Molly about next week. But yesterday when Lovis arrived, she wasn't really keen on spending time with you.

from Anders Wallerman

Nor August

from Anders Wallerman

But that could off course be a reaction to seeing me sad.. so I will talk to them. They are home from school today.

from Anders Wallerman

Other then that we should be good.. 

to Anders Wallerman

Anders - I have invested the last 3 years of my life in supporting you and Food for Progress. I gave up all financial independence, left everything I had behind to move to another country in an alliance with you - that promised me that if things did not work out between us I would not be left with nothing. 

You seem to believe that control and ownership of another person is the way to go in a relationship. I don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm entirely to say no to such a way of life and it‚Äôs not like I haven‚Äôt pleaded for something else and given you plenty of time to change your behaviour. Saturdays event you even made into my own fault for not prioritising you and family. Seriously. And now - you want to leave me with nothing as this in your mind is also alone my own fault. 

Please don‚Äôt be like this!! 

from Anders Wallerman

?

to Anders Wallerman

My debt has doubled in the time I have been with you - something that never got solved cus you spent 3 years not trusting me, saying that I use you and is only here for the money you side to even have when we met. What a joke! 

So for you to just tell me to fuck, that you will ‚Äúfind me a place if you can‚Äù or I can live in the addict of our home or/and hand the car and my home keys over night and then leave me jobless, homeless, carless with no money in my account is the most insane thing I have ever heard you suggest. 

to Anders Wallerman

The money you did not even have*

to Anders Wallerman

And turning the kids against me is just below everything!! 

to Anders Wallerman

There should be plenty of other ways of getting around this situation beside you just becoming a giant asshole! 

from Anders Wallerman

We'll.. wasn't i right.. it's all about the money.. and once the IPO was postponed.. you where gone.. like instantly.. seriously.. 

from Anders Wallerman

I am not turning kids or anything against you.. 
I told them that you had broken up, we had a dinner, talked, and then Lovis arrived sad, as she had been afraid to come here because of you. That's all. 

to Anders Wallerman

It was never about the money Anders - if it was I would have never accepted the financial terms between us through the entire relationship. Unlike you - I never guarded myself for what you are serving me now and that proves that I had way more trust in this relationship than you ever had. How wrong was I about you - such a sad reality to wake up to. 

from Anders Wallerman

Wauw.. that's all i can say. I rest my case. You are right Katja. I am the idiot and I am the one to blame for everything. 

from Anders Wallerman

What you could have done was to prioritize us - not spending night after night with your sister.. nor when we where cracking up and loosing our connection - prioritize party-dinners-with your new Slick-team. Since christmas- we have had 0 things planned between us. Other then the Dominician. 
You have stayed on - fought- to get the Slick-investment done.. and then.. poff.. gone.. When you told me Gita was moving back to Copenhagen.. then It became clear.
So your plan hasn't changed. You have Slick, you have a home here, you are not being kicked out, I will help you Gita, Zina with your new place.. because i am an idiot amd I care for you.. 

to Anders Wallerman

I actually was hoping you‚Äôd move out of the apartment. And that is just one example of you being so very wrong about everything about me. 

I was hoping we could do this a civil way Anders - I still plead for that but you seem very clear in your opinion in regards to how a break up look and that is clearly a break up on your terms only. And I‚Äôm not surprised actually - executing on power is after all also all you can cus being a trusting kind human being is something you seem to have lost a long time ago. 

from Anders Wallerman

Any more insults? Or can we just leave it at that. 

to Anders Wallerman

At least I‚Äôm not accusing you of going on imaginary fuck dates 

from Anders Wallerman
from Anders Wallerman

Pardon? Are you referring to this? 
Or what? 

from Anders Wallerman

Just stop it Katja, you have been on the way out of our relationship for months. You can blame all things on me for sure.. but save your energy. No communication - as we have had it for a few months - is probably the smartest way. You can keep on insulting me for what not. But it won't make yours or my life better. You have come to the conclusion that i am an disrepectful idiot. And that I have manipulated you into everything. I am also you say a liar and much more..
Shall we just leave it at that for today..

to Anders Wallerman

I‚Äôm not at all at those conclusions and I don‚Äôt think those are fair accusations but I have definitely failed at making you understand that. 

We can leave it for today but your suggestion of communication - means what?

from Anders Wallerman

Whatever Katja, just read all your texts from the last 6 months.. 
You have made your standpoint very clear and understandable.
I'm sad/heart-broken/tired and what not - and I have kids to pick-up.
So - you go ahead with your lawyer - on your account - and i'll respond with my lawyer.. ok? 

from Anders Wallerman

We don't need to communicate at all. 
I will have your stuff packed into boxes. I can put your stuff in Gitas room so you have acess without bumping into me, or should i ship it elsewhere? 



from Anders Wallerman

You then have the kitchen table, you can have Gitas bed, and you have the danish table i bought you.. 

from Anders Wallerman

The kids want to keep Leia and Ronja, you can pickup Aslan and Zemin whenever you want. Perhaps they can stay at Gitas place. 

from Anders Wallerman

And off course.. your stuff doesn't need to be moved tomorrow.. i will just prepare.

to Anders Wallerman

So I ended up homeless, jobless, carless and broke over night? Great! I don‚Äôt agree to any of the above and suggest we sit down with one person there is there to make this work for both parties. In your right mind I believe you also think that is reasonable. 

from Anders Wallerman


I have said that i will help with a new place, your job i assume is Slick? As you are the sole owner? I have told you that you have acess to the apartment.. 
I am not intending to move as to the kids. 


to Anders Wallerman

You know very well Slick atm cant provide a job or acces to a car for me. So suggesting that as an instant and reasonable agreement for my life is literately offensive. Is there really no way for us to do something that we both can benefit from? Both mentally and practically?

from Anders Wallerman

I have no clue.. Seems like all the fixing needs to be done by me? Again.. the disrepectful idiot.. 

from Anders Wallerman

For the 95th time.. i will not put you on the street. I will not throw you out. But You have decided to end us. Not me. So obviously you must have had a plan.. you used our money all the way uptil saturdays 5000sek lingerie purchase. After me asking you for a spenditure budget.. after Stockholm/Copenhagens luxury/slick life. An investment for You, what claim is Your company.. 
And you say that i am disrepectful? 
Then you end us, and the reason is that I question your spending on my money on your Slick/lifestyle. People around me just says.. Stop. She is using you.. and you know what.. I believe that to.. eventhough I kept pooring money into our lives.. way to much.. but all with an intent to make our mutual life work/happy. 

to Anders Wallerman

Of course you make this into one big conspiracy against you. Let‚Äôs just leave it for today.

from Anders Wallerman

And now .. Eventhough I have paid for everything.. it's still my fault.. 
and you want to keep having acess to my money. Eventough we are not even #team anymore. It's #Katja all the way

to Anders Wallerman

I just want a fair way - not a Katja way - out of this - it should most definitely not mean that over night I no longer have any resources available.

from Anders Wallerman

And how do you want me to handle that? I asked for some humbleness last week.. and asked you ti be careful on spending.. and what did you do? 
You just kept on spending like there is no tomorrow.. so my trust in how you handle my money.. is not that high. 
It's like you just don't give a fuxx..

from Anders Wallerman

I sent over 5 so that you have for food an what not.

I have informed my parents, Westford/Maria and a few others close to us. Only said that we have broken up. 


from Anders Wallerman

Can you ask Gita or do you know where all the boat keys are?

to Anders Wallerman

They must be in one of the while boxes on the shelf 

from Anders Wallerman

Seem like they are not.. 

to Anders Wallerman

I actually think you gave the keys to your parents 

from Anders Wallerman

Yeah your right.. 

from Anders Wallerman

I just talked to G, planning his visit.
He said 2 things that are bot true:
1. You have all the access you want to the apartment. Not only tomorrow
2. I did not end our relationship.. perhaps not important any more, you decided to go through with the break-up.

This is not to start any new fights or what not. I just want to make it clear. 
I am super-tired and an emotional mess from this failure of us.

to Anders Wallerman

1: I asked for access to our home without your presence and since you then decided to turn your kids against me, I need access to the apartment without you and your kids.

2: it should not and will not matter who ended this relationship. You need to act like a decent human being - both practically and financially - that‚Äôs after all something you have promised me. 


from Anders Wallerman

1. I have done No such thing. They are stressed like us.
2. It applies for both of us. Respect for all things incl money and how things are described for our mutual friends.
I have said 95 times that you have acess to oir home.. and still the first thing G says is that i have thrown you, so both ways.
I will not be yelling or screaming .. you shouldn't either

to Anders Wallerman

No Anders you have told me you will pack my things and send them to me. You say I can pick up two cats when possible. You add that Molly ah e no interest in hanging out with me after your talk - this letting me know that my access to my home is not so easy anymore! You strip me of money (my Swedish card is in Sweden - so thanks for cancelling the one card I depend on), tells me to hand over my car as it is sold, tell me ‚Äúyou will find me a home‚Äù, expect Slick to be my new income and dump a 500.000 ask bill on the project. All of that is in writing and not for discussion. And none of it is OK!!! 

I expect your lawyer - whom ever it is - to offer me a financial and practical FAIR settlement and let me know when I can get into my home for a few days on my own. This upcoming weekend would fit perfectly - you go play some more golf and have Molly visit her mom. It should be the least thing you do! 

from Anders Wallerman

I would need the Invoices that has gone to Svea Inkasso aswell. Could you send me the details please

from Anders Wallerman

I have paid the 2 invoices, but they claim there is 2 more.. that has already been sent to Svea Inkasso. They are in your name so they should be paid asap.. 


from Anders Wallerman
from Anders Wallerman
from Anders Wallerman

Invoices now paid for. /Anders

to Anders Wallerman

Great thing you did for your self there. And now you want to be treated as a man who ‚Äúdid the right thing‚Äù with one hand  - while still very deliberately drowning me with the other? /Katja 

from Anders Wallerman


Katja,
Please try to see me for what I am and what I do and have done, and not for words and texts under fights. I have no other intention but to help. And that because I love you and care for you. If I would have had any other intention I would have stopped all dialogues and  also not paid for anything.

I feel that we have derailed in our relationship as we have stopped listening to one another. Not stopped talking but stopped listening (And we only talk through sms)

If you wish to give this one last try, I am willing to do so but I understand if you have passed that point. If not, I feel we have to go all in, take concelling with our dialogue. I just do not want to continue this verbal war through sms.


to Anders Wallerman

ARE UOU STILL JUSTIFYING TAKING EVERYTHING FROM ME IN 24/7!!! SVOWING ME THAT AFTER 3 YEARS WITH UOU - SUPPORTING YOUR FAMILY AND BUSINESS I HAVE NOTHING - ONLY TO BE THROWN TO THE STREETS - FOR SOMETHING THAT I DID NOT DO!!???? ARE YOU INSANE!!!!?????


I HATE YOY - YOU ARE AS FUXXING FAKE,  FULL OF SHIT AND EMTY PROMISES AS THE FAKE RING YOU PUT ON MY FINGER!!!! ALL YOU CARE ABIUT IS YOU!!!! YOU YOU YOU!!!!!!


GET YOU LAYWER WORKING AND LET ME KNOW WHEN I CAN ACCESS MY HOME FUXXING WITHOUT YOU AND MOLLY IN IT! I ASKED FOR NEXT WEEKEDN AT LEAST!!!

to Anders Wallerman

AND DONT CONTACT NE ANYMORE!!!!

to Anders Wallerman

TRY ONE NORE TIME? TO FIGURE WHAT OUT!???  FUXXING MANIPULATIVE FUCK!!!!! 

from Anders Wallerman
to Anders Wallerman

And that is your answer to my e-mail? 

from Anders Wallerman

No no.. 
i sent this before. To inform you.
I really appreciated the mail. I am driving at the moment.

to Anders Wallerman
to Anders Wallerman
to Anders Wallerman

I hear that last night you had to have Molly ask Gita if she had my card - as I had said. Apparently you did not believe me - so here is two photos of Gita holding the card - back and front - with today‚Äôs date and visuals of her apartment in Sweden. Look at your app and see where I am. Hope that clarifies things for you.

from Anders Wallerman

No no Katja.. Guiseppe had an idea to meet up with you and bring the card. And we couldn't find it. 

to Anders Wallerman

Of course you could not find it - Gita had it which I had told you both several times. 

from Anders Wallerman

Relax - we ment well.. 

to Anders Wallerman

Grow up - I meant that well. 

from Anders Wallerman

Driving home .

For you planning. I will go with the kids to V√§stervik from friday (5pm) and return back sunday evening

to Anders Wallerman

Ok

from Anders Wallerman

Caroline picks up molly from school at 3:30pm
August had Soccer practise at 5:30pm he will be going to the apartment at 5pm to pickup his soccer-things.
Would 6pm for me and Molly be okay on Sunday to arrive home?

from Anders Wallerman

August has

from Anders Wallerman

Practice tomorrow that is..

from Anders Wallerman

We will leave the key under the lamp. 
There is cat-food but you probably need to buy some more.
The cleaning lady has not been here as we had not cleared the invoices. They will be here from next week.


to Anders Wallerman

Ok - to everything.

from Anders Wallerman

August soccer practice is done. Is it ok for you to arrive at 7pm. Then i can pack everything for the weekend and drive to pick him up 6:30. Let me know

from Anders Wallerman

If not I can be out at 5-ish..

to Anders Wallerman

I have basically been couch surfing and living in a car during all of this - only so my needs would not compromise what best for you and the kids - I would very much appreciate if my one weekend at home is not made into anything less than already arranged. 

from Anders Wallerman

Ok

from Anders Wallerman

I will leave at 5 as we agreed

from Anders Wallerman

Ok with same setup next weekend? Then i'll plan for that.

to Anders Wallerman

I have already suggested a plan forward - you chose to ignore that e-mail or even come up with an alternative. I hope you understand that a plan forward - only giving me the option to enter my home on weekends and then everything else in my life is left for you to do with what you want - is not really working for me.

from Anders Wallerman

I was referring to the timings only.
I am meeting with the lawyer monday as you know to create the formal solution for all things - he will then communicate directly with you. I appoligize if that was not clear.

to Anders Wallerman

Ok.

from Anders Wallerman

I have been offered to rent a house in Vadstena next week today. I would need acces to the apartment for clothes etc during the week but me and Molly can stay there if that would be of interest for you. This is A suggestion, nothing else

to Anders Wallerman

If you can do that and it works for you both - I then think you should do that - I would also appreciate as little
couch-surfing as possible. 

to Anders Wallerman

I‚Äôm at the gym and the door is locked - when will you drop by? 

from Anders Wallerman

Molly needs to get in tomorrow to get stuff before school. Can she come by once we have checked in to the house. At 5pm aprox.

I would need to get in to. So perhaps you can go to Gita at 2pm for a while and we drop by and grab stuff?

from Anders Wallerman

Molly will be back later so that would be me at 2 pm.

to Anders Wallerman

Ok. No problem. 

Another thing os the car - it really needs service. I know I need to deliver it back to you soon but I would like for it to be safe and legal to drive while I still have it. It needs new tires too but they ordered new ones for it when I changed from winter tires - so I think I can get them changed next week too. 

to Anders Wallerman

So I‚Äôm basically asking if you will book the service for it next week and then I will take it to Sthlm - assuming I can pick it up again of course. 

from Anders Wallerman

I will ask if they can take the car in this week, but it could be that they don't have time. 
If not, service needs to be done elsewhere.
Change the tires if they have arrived. Yes for you to continue use the car.

to Anders Wallerman

Ok.


from Anders Wallerman

We have picked up the stuff we need

to Anders Wallerman

ok - have a good Sunday. Hope the house is nice.

from Anders Wallerman

You too
The house is ok

from Anders Wallerman

I don't want to regret never asking you one last time. Are we really doing this? Ending us? I am going into the lawyers meeting at 10

to Anders Wallerman

I wish things were different but none of us are thriving in this relationship.

from Anders Wallerman

I have prolonged the house 1 week. Uptil friday the 13/th fyi

to Anders Wallerman

Ok. Have you checked out the options for car service? 

from Anders Wallerman

Yes, but no response yet. I talked to Robin so you could call him.
I am down emtying the boat. Where do you want your stuff? 

from Anders Wallerman

The cat cage etc? Do you want it? 

from Anders Wallerman

Or should I get rid of them? 

from Anders Wallerman
from Anders Wallerman

I need an aswer

to Anders Wallerman

Well - I don‚Äôt know what ‚Äúetc‚Äù means so I can‚Äôt really tell you to just throw it out? Is it a problem bringing it back? The cat cage will probably be needed right? 

from Anders Wallerman

The clothes and stuff wasn't that much. I have packed that in a bag for you.
But bring the 2 big cat-boxes is more problematic. 
I'll bring the travel-box and drop it of out side the apartment tonight with your clothes and shoes.

to Anders Wallerman

Ok - well - cat boxes can be replaced I guess. 

from Anders Wallerman

Or i leave it all here and you go down and get your stuff. 
Leika box is in the bag that i'm bringing. 


to Anders Wallerman

Eh what? 

to Anders Wallerman

What are you bringing and what are you leaving for me to pick up? 

to Anders Wallerman

Ok I misunderstood. Leave the cat boxes - bring my stuff - can we agree on that? 

from Anders Wallerman

Ok to the last

from Anders Wallerman

I will be able to bring the travel-box.. the really big one.. the other cat-stuff i will throw. 

from Anders Wallerman

Can i drop off some stuff from the boat in the apartment during the afternoon? 

to Anders Wallerman

You can - but when? I‚Äôm at a hair dresser in Motala  - my hair basically started to fall off‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm not back before in a couple of hours from now. 

from Anders Wallerman

It's your stuff mostly+ the padeIboard,  will put it outside

to Anders Wallerman

Ok

from Anders Wallerman

Will you put the pdelbord + the few things to the scooter in august room please

to Anders Wallerman

Of course 

from Anders Wallerman

Are you sending the swish nr? 

to Anders Wallerman
to Anders Wallerman

to Anders Wallerman

I will take ale that heart back - did you shut down tor card again? Seriously? 

from Anders Wallerman

No. I have not shut down anything.. 

to Anders Wallerman

Ok - Weird then  - I‚Äôm sorry

from Anders Wallerman
from Anders Wallerman

I think there has been a new card sent out..


from Anders Wallerman

Can you check the mailbox.. but it's still weird.. i haven't ordered any card

from Anders Wallerman

Where did you try to buy? Online? In the store? 

from Anders Wallerman

Hall√•? 

to Anders Wallerman

I will check for the card - I was trying to take out 1500 kr out as food money for Gita. 

from Anders Wallerman

Ok. My card is never open for cash withdrawals.. from all they years of travel. I just used it and it worked . (Online) 
Let me know when you are taking out money and i can open it

from Anders Wallerman
from Anders Wallerman

The card is now open for withdrawals.. but I would mike to keep that closed. Much much harder to prove if the card get skimmed or what not.. then an online transaction where there is digital trace

from Anders Wallerman

Like

from Anders Wallerman

Let's just stop all of this unesserary waste of bad energy. 
Your point of contact from now is :

from Anders Wallerman
from Anders Wallerman

He will return back with the practical stuff. And I have told him that I will pay for a lawyer - Hour. So that you have legal council on your part. 
Todays action was enough. 
Never contact me again. Ever

to Anders Wallerman

Ok but what actions are you referring to? I hope my appreciation earlier when I called was clear‚Ä¶ 

from Anders Wallerman
from Anders Wallerman

I obviously help you, and then 2 seconds later i am a dick again.. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

to Anders Wallerman

Anders - you obviously see things the way you want to see them - so you read what you want from yesterday‚Äôs texts - I have learned over the past 3 years that explaining myself is of no use. 

What breaks my heart more than never to have earned your trust, is that you will never know how much I actually loved you.

from Anders Wallerman
from Anders Wallerman

My car has broken down and needs to be fixed. 
I would like to suggest the following solution, as i need a car with alco-lock.
I rent a decent car for you on monday, I take your car and drive that, fixing service and what not. If not, I have No car for the time that it takes to fix mine. 
Would that be ok?

from Anders Wallerman

Really disappointed by your decision.
I am NOT taking the car away from you, you will have acess to it as soon as my car is fixed. 
I am organizing things so both you and I have a car.
I know i should have adressed this through the lawyer.. but seriously.
But you set the bar.. 
It's making my life more complicated - but most of all, it hurts the kids, August. 
Thanks! 


to Anders Wallerman

I of course don‚Äôt want to put you or August in a bad position, but it‚Äôs really hard for me to trust you. And I need my car. I have also been waiting for your lawyer to come back to me and I‚Äôm starting to think it‚Äôs a bit weird that you tell me he is my point of contact, yet he has not answered my e-mail sent yesterday morning or returned my call this morning. And now you want me to hand over my car - that you have told me is sold. I really don‚Äôt know what to think anymore‚Ä¶.

from Anders Wallerman

You believe what you want to believe.. 
1. It's not Your car! It's a company car
2. I am also waiting for the response from the lawyer. To finalize this shit.
3. I don't give a shit what you think. 
YOU are in the apartment, YOU have my card, YOU get an alternative solution as my Car is Broken.. 
4. YOU decide to put YOU first.. 

You can think what you want of me, treat me as you like.. but when you fuxxing makes life impossible for my kids.. well, that makes all the difference.


from Anders Wallerman

So as you don't trust me.. altough all the above.. i won't trust you. 
Card stopped

from Anders Wallerman

Let the lawyers figure ot out.. 

from Anders Wallerman

Suit me

from Anders Wallerman

Thank you for updating the rest of the family that you are Not using the the apartment this week.
Why actual fuxx do i need to take my kids out if there if you are not even in it??? We will move back in there friday as planned, 5 pm. Is that ok?

from Anders Wallerman

Molly just told me that you are in DK

from Anders Wallerman

So i am not stalking you.. if that is what you want to fight me on..  

from Anders Wallerman

I guess Gita is in the apartment. 
Give her heads up that we will be back tomorrow afternoon.

to Anders Wallerman

Anders - your lawyer assistant is not answering me. Therefore I try you directly now - if you don‚Äôt answer that‚Äôs fine but I‚Äôm hoping you are up for a respectful discussion in regards a to the car and apartment. Right now I feel all you ask for is leaving me with nothing and it‚Äôs hard for me to work with you that way. Can we talk about a different way of doing things than what is currently suggested from the lawyer assistant?

from Anders Wallerman
from Anders Wallerman

No intention to leave you with nothing. Just following the suggested plan you wanted - communication through the lawyer. 


from Anders Wallerman

I am willing to listen

to Anders Wallerman

I don‚Äôt think it is fair that you want me to leave the apartment on Sunday - not letting me know when I can come back, all while knowing I have no money or no place to go. 

Also I think it is not fair that you want to borrow my car because yours needs service and then between the lines want me to hand over my car permanently for a rental for two months - which you can terminate after your pleasing.

I am happy to work with you on both car and apartment but you also need to work with me. Is that something you want to discuss further with me?

to Anders Wallerman
from Anders Wallerman

1. The kids and me have been living outside our home  for 2 weeks. It seems fair that we get acess aswell ss you have had.
You or me have equal rights to be there. I have no plan on what you want or your plans going forward- hence I did not include any notice about how long or what not. I am willing to agree on something that works for both.
Now the legal way is the lawyers way - unless we agree. According to Swedish law.
2. It's not your car - it's a company car. I have no intention of taking your car away from you as I know you need it. My plan was to get you a car while mine is being fixed. And then if we would have agreed in the package from the lawyer - either return the car to you for the agreed period, or find another solution. 
The lawyer way is actually Erik's and HR's way. The car has nothing to do with our separation. As it's a company car.
3. Your invoice for april is approved. Coming back to the package that the lawyer will suggest when he is back.
4. Your future plans, you only know about them. I don't. So difficult for me to work on solutions for. But i'm willing to do that. 







to Anders Wallerman

I have already suggested a short term solution but you never replied to that - so what do you suggest we do from here? 

from Anders Wallerman

My plan was to respond with a package inc everything through the lawyer. 
Where you and him and potentially your legal council would be able to discuss the practicalities.

from Anders Wallerman

And that is what I have been working on. Inc how to make a legal structure work for slick. 

to Anders Wallerman

And in the mean time you have not felt any responsibility in regards to me having roof over my head or money for food. You also know very well the money from my invoice with is mainly earmarked for other purposes does not give me any safety what so ever. So is what you are saying, that I basically just need to hand over the apartment and the car for good, immediately, and then fuck off into nothing? 

to Anders Wallerman

Please explain what I have and not what I don‚Äôt have - I‚Äôm trying to figure out my options here?

to Anders Wallerman

Short term

from Anders Wallerman

You have acess to a car+gascard, you can agree with me on the apartment, how we share or what we do, Money to solve your immediate needs, or I can rent something like we have been forced to do. 
Until the package is agreed on.
But i would expect you to work with me on for example the car and not using the kids as a weapon in our disagreement. They have done nothing to deserve that

to Anders Wallerman

The kids does definitely not need to be suffering from this - nor should Zina sit and not be able to pay rent. 

And to be honest I‚Äôm not really up for negotiations, I think from what you just wrote, you should just tell me how we do this from Sunday.

from Anders Wallerman

Well, they are suffering.. I can't pickup/leave the August. The both of them are rejected acess to there home.
Zina, we'll that's a money thing. Your spenditure and bills to be paid. 
I don't understand you at all. 
Other then that I assume that we are back where we started.


from Anders Wallerman

And as you misunderstand everything.
Your short term needs of cash would include Zina's rent etc. 
Until the package is agreed on.. 


from Anders Wallerman

I don‚Äôt think it is fair that you want me to leave the apartment on Sunday - not letting me know when I can come back, all while knowing I have no money or no place to go. 

Also I think it is not fair that you want to borrow my car because yours needs service and then between the lines want me to hand over my car permanently for a rental for two months - which you can terminate after your pleasing.

I am happy to work with you on both car and apartment but you also need to work with me. Is that something you want to discuss further with me?

from Anders Wallerman

This is what you wrote??

to Anders Wallerman

I don‚Äôt want to argue - I just want a fair plan for all - of course kids including. 

So please rent me a place here in Vadstena for the next two weeks and if we are not done with this short term agreement in 2 weeks from now, I get the apartment back for another two weeks starting of the Friday at 17:00 . I will hand over the car (when?) and take the rental as you have suggested and you will provide me some money. Is that what you have in mind and something you can live with for the next two weeks?

from Anders Wallerman

I suggest the following:
I have the apartment 15-20th (sunday from 17:00 to friday morning)
You can then choose if you want to stay there over the weekend 20-22nd as we sre not going to be there. 
22nd to 29th Me and the kids stay there.

Agree to the above and I will try to find a place in Vadstena or Motala.

Car
My car is seriously broken and should not be driven 1m. your rental is ready so I suggest you reach out to Anna-karin at sixt and agree on a timing for tonight or tomorrow morning. They will help even though it's outside office hours. 

Money. 
How much do you need?

from Anders Wallerman
from Anders Wallerman

And then we try to solve all other things within that time-period

to Anders Wallerman

I can live with that and I‚Äôd prefer something in or outside of Vadstena than somethjng central Motala. Unless it is outside Motala of course and I need this agreement to run for as long as it takes to fix the legal package. 

I will return the car tomorrow before noon and arrange with Anna-Karin. I would like a transfer of 20k.

to Anders Wallerman

And you and the kids can of course have the apartment whenever during the whole period as long as there is somewhere for me to go. 

from Anders Wallerman

But to save money.. 
as these short term rents are expensive. Are you ok with the dates proposed? 

to Anders Wallerman

I‚Äôm ok with the dates 

to Anders Wallerman

But that‚Äôs also why I‚Äôm good with something not central‚Ä¶

from Anders Wallerman

Kolla in detta boende p√• Airbnb!

from Anders Wallerman

https://abnb.me/WHLNxgJ4Zpb

from Anders Wallerman

I found this, expensive but still

to Anders Wallerman

Looks like the place where Ronald stayed, right. But it works. 

from Anders Wallerman

Is it? 
You can have a look if there is another plave you rather want.
Can you please also confirm with Sixt so they are prepped tomorrow morning.

to Anders Wallerman

I think it is but it doesn‚Äôt matter. I will have a look anyways - so just give me 10 minutes. Also I will reach out to Anna-Karin.

from Anders Wallerman

No stress.. 

to Anders Wallerman

I think the one you suggested is best. Let‚Äôs go with that. 

to Anders Wallerman
from Anders Wallerman

So I'll book sunday to friday and then you stay in the apartment during the weekend?
And then i'll rebook for the following week?

to Anders Wallerman

Yes. 

to Anders Wallerman

And money - what did we agree on? 

from Anders Wallerman

I'll transfer so you can pay bills

to Anders Wallerman

And what does that mean? 

from Anders Wallerman

20 was what you asked for right? 

to Anders Wallerman

Yes but you did not respond to that. 

to Anders Wallerman

That‚Äôs why I asked

from Anders Wallerman

Ok

from Anders Wallerman

For the second week- you need to have a look at where you want to stay. It seems like this apartment is not available. Will you check? 

to Anders Wallerman

Yes

to Anders Wallerman

Sent you a link on e-mail

from Anders Wallerman

I have requested to rent- seems like the host needs to comfirm. Sent you the "request-confirmation".
They still though charged me for the stay?ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è eventhough i read it as it needs to be confirmed

from Anders Wallerman
from Anders Wallerman

Confirmed

from Anders Wallerman
from Anders Wallerman
to Anders Wallerman

I will reach out to them. 

to Anders Wallerman

Handed over the car - say hi to Karl Magnus and Parmida. 

from Anders Wallerman

I picked the car up.
The tires back is Really bad.. üôà
I will

to Anders Wallerman

Happy that I could contribute to not making things difficult for you and August this weekend. Enjoy the party when you get there. 

to Anders Wallerman
to Anders Wallerman

I‚Äôm leaving the apartment now - left these for you. 

from Anders Wallerman

üëç

to Anders Wallerman

Have you shot down my e-mail adress? 

from Anders Wallerman

Nope, haven't touched anything

from Anders Wallerman

I will never do anything unless you are informed. I can check with Erik/Jonas if they have as you are not working anymore. 

to Anders Wallerman

Thats also why I find it weird - it asked for my password and when I typed it in it just locked. 

to Anders Wallerman
from Anders Wallerman

Check with Jonas. Or i'll inform them monday

to Anders Wallerman

Thank you

to Anders Wallerman

I have left the apartment. Molly is home. 

from Anders Wallerman

Ok

to Anders Wallerman

Good morning - when you contact FFP in regards to my e-mail account - will you also remind them on my invoice? It‚Äôs still not paired and it‚Äôs becoming a really big problem for me. 

from Anders Wallerman

I informed them friday already

to Anders Wallerman

And about the invoice? 

from Anders Wallerman

About the invoice.. I will email Jonas about the email once i'm home from dropping of August

to Anders Wallerman

Ok 

from Anders Wallerman

Where is the key to the postbox? 

to Anders Wallerman

Should be on the shelf

from Anders Wallerman

Found it.
I can't find all the papers on my driving-license. Do you know where Gita put them? 

to Anders Wallerman

I don‚Äôt know but I can ask her when I talk to her later - doubt she‚Äôs up right now.

from Anders Wallerman
to Anders Wallerman

Thank you

to Anders Wallerman

Hey - I‚Äôm really sorry for the both of us that I have to reach out about this again - but why is Carlborg not making the transfer? 

from Anders Wallerman

It should have been made by Carl yesterday. Carlborg is no longer with FFP. You can email Carl on the topic further on. I will check

to Anders Wallerman

Ok - I did of course not know that Carlborg had already left and if Carl made the payment yesterday, then good. Thanks

to Anders Wallerman

Seriously Anders - please reach out to Carl immediately and have him send a receipt for the transfer. 

from Anders Wallerman

Don't fuxxing talk to me like that.. enough

to Anders Wallerman

FYI I can talk to you exactly as I want - and I have been extremely polite and patient for almost two weeks while you and FFP apparently are not doing as you have promised - regardless of your e-mail. 

I‚Äôm pretty sure if I had you wait two weeks for the apparently meant key - cus I couldn‚Äôt be bothered to put it on my priority list and you had to wake up every day and remind me in a nice and respectful way - at one point you would run out of patience too and probably WAY earlier than me. Have a great fuxxing day Anders! 

from Anders Wallerman

Fuxx you too Katja. Me personally, i have done everything you ask for. 
So shut the fuxx up.. 

from Anders Wallerman

And do as you suggested weeks ago. DON'T contact me directly..

to Anders Wallerman

Everything I have asked for? Biggest joke in the world. You haven‚Äôt even done half of what you yourself suggested - during the ENTIRE relationship! 

from Anders Wallerman

Fuxx you too.. gold digger go find nr 4 and fuxx him over to.. ha ha.. y

from Anders Wallerman

I leave the apartment @17 today. 
Will be back monday the 6th. 
I will need acess to the apartment 6-7th to repack. 
From the 7-14th i'm away. 15-16 i need acess to repack. Then from the 18 and onwards I need acess.
Aslan has not been home for 2 days fyi.

from Anders Wallerman

If have a scheduled call with the lawyer tomorrow.

from Anders Wallerman

If you are not arriving then we will stay in the apartment. 
We will though depart tuesday as you know to South Africa.

to Anders Wallerman

Are you in the apartment or are you out of the apartment? 

from Anders Wallerman

If you arrive we will leave now

to Anders Wallerman

You stay - I will arrive tomorrow and let my sister know you are there tonight and take care of the cats. When can I enter tomorrow?

from Anders Wallerman

Then i'd rather stay until tuesday evening when we depart for SA. You can acess the apartment tuesday @6.

to Anders Wallerman

I need the place tomorrow, Zina is joining me up here‚Ä¶

from Anders Wallerman

The house is available

to Anders Wallerman

Well - why don‚Äôt you go there then? The apartment is for me the next two weeks.

to Anders Wallerman

You clearly had a plan at 13:38 today - I suggest you stick to that if this is also going to be a problem - or stay until tomorrow. But I need the place tomorrow afternoon.

from Anders Wallerman

You have not answered to the suggested plan.. 
And as you are being the bitch you are.. i'll stay in the aparment until tuesday when we leave for SA. Not moving the kids around anymore.. 
do what you want

from Anders Wallerman

Key will be under the lamp. We will leave in 20 

to Anders Wallerman

Ok

from Anders Wallerman

I will be arriving back to the apartment in 2 hours fyi

to Anders Wallerman

And when are you leaving again - a repack surely doesn‚Äôt have to take 24 hours? 

from Anders Wallerman

I need to wash, will be departing tomorrow. Exactly as i wrote you 29th of may

to Anders Wallerman

Ok - then I‚Äôll stay in the apartment until the 15th this time, as you have now extended your stay there with an extra 3 days. 

from Anders Wallerman

Extended what? 

to Anders Wallerman

Your stay in the apartment.

from Anders Wallerman

I will be back in Sweden on the 14th. So if you want to stay until 15, no probs. I just need to pass by and re-pack

to Anders Wallerman


üëçüèª

from Anders Wallerman

‚ûú Replying to you, 2022-06-06 10:34:30: ¬´ Your stay in the apartment. ¬ª

I haven't extended anything. 
Read the text from the 29th? What has changed??

to Anders Wallerman

I was supposed to arrive last Sunday but you got pissed at me for not answering your text fast enough - so you decided regardless of my plans to stay until Tuesday. And now you want another 24 hours - 3 days in total where I was supposed to be at home but where you insist on something else.

from Anders Wallerman

We'll .. then you stay in the apartment.. i will be back in an hour.. no probs.. 

to Anders Wallerman

No Anders - you don‚Äôt get to do this anymore.. bossing me around for your benefit. I am coming back tomorrow as you requested and I‚Äôm then staying until the 15th. From there you have the place in two weeks.Have Fredric and Mia discuss an alternative if you need that.

from Anders Wallerman

I don't need any other alternative. You are just not mentally strong enough obviously to recomprehend what you actually just summed up. 
How on earth could i be bossing you around when My suggestion (sent 2 weeks ago) is the same as your sum up?? üòÇ with the only add-on.. would be that I very swiftly said ok when you asked to stay one day longer.. ?? 



to Anders Wallerman

I‚Äôm having a lawyer next to me right now - you just keep on going Anders‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. 

from Anders Wallerman

Ha ha ha.. 

from Anders Wallerman

Then I suggest you start your legal process on the apartment. So one of us can move out.. like now..

to Anders Wallerman

Oh I have started it - waiting on my Swedish lawyer‚Ä¶. 

to Anders Wallerman

But you will get the apartment - I‚Äôm ok with leaving - but we need that legal document made and signed. So please have your lawyer get moving to do it won‚Äôt take you another 5 weeks to only ask me two questions that does not solve the entire shit show between us. 

from Anders Wallerman

Well.. fyi.. it's not Fredrik that is taking time.. it's the setup legally/tax wize/practical on getting Slick in place for all parties. 
I can obviously stop that and then you figure out a suggestion for me and FFP? 


from Anders Wallerman

To take over the assets of Slick

to Anders Wallerman

Thats ok - my lawyer needs some time to grasp the reality of our relationship anyways‚Ä¶ But leave those details and questions to the lawyers as planned‚Ä¶that‚Äôs why there are involved.

I‚Äôm out of the apartment on the 15th of June again - unless our we through our lawyers have decided on something else. Enjoy your day at home.

from Anders Wallerman

Ok, then i'll stop the progressive work and we'll let the lawyers settle it all.. 

Perfect! 

You too

to Anders Wallerman

No I‚Äôm not saying that - keep everything going please as I want this to be done and over with as much as you. 

to Anders Wallerman

Anyways - great conversation (insert sarcasm) really reminded me of why our lawyers are involved. 

Let me know when you leave the apartment tomorrow. No later than 6pm as normal please - I have plans at home.

from Anders Wallerman

Could agree more. I don't recognize you at all.. 
but hey! Nice to finally get to know the real Katja.. 

I will be out at 7am at the latest.

to Anders Wallerman

The same Anders - you are most definitely not the man you said you were. 

from Anders Wallerman

But you turned up to be exactly what I started feeling you where after 2.5 yearsüëçüëç

from Anders Wallerman

But.. let's just agree on that we hate eachother and move on. Let the lawyers set/organize the split and then I hope i never ever need to meet you again.. 

to Anders Wallerman

I don‚Äôt hate you Anders, never have I hated you - on the contrary, I loved you so much - I also forgave so much and continued to love you‚Ä¶ 

But you seriously had a clear pattern of not trusting me, refusing to trust me and from day one accusing me insane shit over and over again despite it being only in your head. It never stopped - it was on a monthly if not weekly basis from day one! 

No one deserves to live like that - you would have left my ass too, if I after almost 4 years and a marriage planned - did not trust at all, tracked your car, went into your phone and computer constantly looking for clues of deception, constantly accused you of having an agenda, having a secret life, an aggressive tone, being complicated and a bitch the minute you‚Äôd express an independent opinion or a need‚Ä¶ you would have fuxxing left me too!

As I see this, my trust in you and love for you and us actually carried us most of the way - your lack of trust just took it all away. 

So please do not lecture me about love or true intentions, when I‚Äôm the one here left asking myself if you were honest - when I a few years back asked you why you were even in a relationship with me. I asked when it had become obvious that you were only giving me trust professionally and not personally‚Ä¶..

You answered me - without hesitation - that I was just convenient. For years I thought you were just being rude - right now I think you actually told me the truth.  


from Anders Wallerman

Wauw.. you are a good story teller.. 
have you forgotten what you called me the first, second, 10 time.. I said no financilly or asked for some humbleness.. 
You really struck the tone on who I am as a person, my history, how bad as a person I am, how bad as a leader, liar, worthless.. i can continue.. for a long while.. how bad I am as a parent because of shortcomings.. 
So I thank for the story.. but your words and actions the last year says more.
I am ok if I pay up.. That's it.. 



from Anders Wallerman

While your actions have always been justified. You made us houserules.. and where the one breaking them constantly in aggressive outbursts.. All of them related to Slick.. and your feeling of me not stepping up.. so i'm sorry.. 


from Anders Wallerman

I will always look back at our first 2 1/2 years with joy. We had bad times.. but i really felt we where a team and I really enjoyed trying to build a great life togehter. 
Eventhough it wasn't true.. you so neatly wrapped that up when you in a text the other day, more or less made fun of me because of the wife/husbad thing.. me then being the instigator to that.. 
You are cold motherfuxxer.. I'll give you that. 

from Anders Wallerman

I have always believed that if you are partners.. you include, introduce, share.. you don't have 99% of your friends outside the relationship. Like you. 
For me having secret online-friends is a bit like cheating.. 
you had 99% secret - I have heard about them but never met..you never socialized with then while I was around.. Why the secrecy? Why NO interaction with anything from your past? Absolutely No-one? 
Controlling the story perhaps.. 

to Anders Wallerman

Look back at the first 2,5 years of our relationship with joy you say? Since you mention it, I have as a matter of fact also taken a hard look back on our entire relationship and there is a now a time-line existing - based on only what‚Äôs in our text messages, so I will not be called a lying fool trying to control the story. It proves - very often in your own words -  that our relationship certainly was not as you now present it and calling me a great story teller is a pathetic defence. 

You have seriously accused me of so many crazy things, even things I had long forgotten, you have constantly acted out over nothing and punished me for things that never even happened, kicked me out of endless hotel rooms and also our relationship at least 2-7 times per month - no exceptions - since day one. My lawyer received it last week.

So please go ahead and continue to call me a liar with an agenda - which you by the way have accused me of since day one - all I have to say is: read our text messages from through the years. It will probably take you a week but it will give you or at least your lawyer a full picture of the truth.

Now - unless you have any more shit to throw at me - I will leave this conversation now. 


from Anders Wallerman

I 100% let's stop this

from Anders Wallerman

Left the apartment, Molly will be back after School for some time

to Anders Wallerman

üëçüèª

from Anders Wallerman

Fyi - Molly is here.

from Anders Wallerman

I just heard.. i agreed with Caroline to organise with Molly. 
I'll talk to them. Just landed so i need a few minutes

to Anders Wallerman

Its fine - just wanted you to know.

from Anders Wallerman

Ok thank you

to Anders Wallerman

Molly told me that you had told her that she should be home on her own this week? Is she not going to Carolines place at all? 

from Anders Wallerman

No no.. 

from Anders Wallerman

I had no clue that Molly was in Vadstena so give me a fuxxing break. 

from Anders Wallerman

What about the cats? 

to Anders Wallerman

Who is taking care of the cats? 

from Anders Wallerman

Seriously!?

to Anders Wallerman

Yes seriously!!???

to Anders Wallerman

Wtf!!??

from Anders Wallerman

I left yesterday, Linus is giving them food twice a day until i'm home? 
Have a problem with that?

to Anders Wallerman

No - I don‚Äôt have a problem with that - which is obviously news for me as I thought you were there. But fine with the cats and Linus - get Molly and her party in fuxxing order or I lol have Elena call the police! 

from Anders Wallerman

And why would you call the police? 
Have you lost it completely? 


to Anders Wallerman

Because your 14 daughter is having a party with a lot of older guys‚Ä¶.

from Anders Wallerman

And thats illegal? 

from Anders Wallerman

You call the police! Do that! 

to Anders Wallerman

Yes it is.

to Anders Wallerman

I told you to fix it

from Anders Wallerman

I will tell Molly you will call the police.
Fix what? 

to Anders Wallerman

If not  I will 

from Anders Wallerman

You call the police!

to Anders Wallerman

Fix her not having a party with older guys around

from Anders Wallerman

And that's your call? 

from Anders Wallerman

I wasn't aware.. The kids are With Caroline this weekend!!!üíÅüíÅüíÅüíÅ

from Anders Wallerman

I have texted Caroline and asked wtf

to Anders Wallerman

Well done taking adult responsibility- I‚Äôm trying to give you a hand here fixing it - do that please and no police will be involved. But if you don‚Äôt - I will call the police - I don‚Äôt want a 14 year old throwing a party with no adult supervision in my home. 

from Anders Wallerman

This is NEWS for me.. 
so let me handle it.. 
Caroline has the KIDS this weekend.. what are you not understanding..
BUT do call the police.. 

to Anders Wallerman

I am letting you handle it - are you doing that or are you bitching at me - get your sit in order!!! 

from Anders Wallerman

Fuxx you

from Anders Wallerman

Seriously..

I read the mail you sent to the lawyer.. 

I know that you are trying to build a case against me on all kind of levels. So please, call the police.. 

to Anders Wallerman

Just have the good damn party stopped immensely! 

from Anders Wallerman

Why? 

to Anders Wallerman

Then we can talk intentions when due cause is.

from Anders Wallerman

What intentions? 

from Anders Wallerman

Are you high?

from Anders Wallerman
to Anders Wallerman

Obviously not - i was aware of the reality of your daugters shotsjow well before you and Caroline - well done on the parenting! 

to Anders Wallerman

30-50 people visited - make sure it stops / right now. 

to Anders Wallerman

This obviously has nothing to to with the e-mail I have sent to your lawyer. This has something to do with the fact that the neighbour is contacting me because you and Caroline don't have Molly under control. Apparently you still don't. 

My e-mail last week was sent in order for you and your lawyer to act according to reality and not your fuxxing games. I'm very much looking forward to your response, so we can get this shit over with asap. 

from Anders Wallerman

I need to pickup keys at 13pm today in the apartment. Will be there for 30 min tops

from Anders Wallerman

You have no legal right to not let me enter the apartment. 
I need the keys as the cars are being returned. 
If an option is for you to collect all porsche keys and put them in the mailbox that works for me. 
I have no intention to argue nor meet or anything else. Just need the keys 

to Anders Wallerman

Don‚Äôt show up!! 

from Anders Wallerman

You can't decide that

from Anders Wallerman

I need the car keys today and I have the legal right to pick them up

to Anders Wallerman

I legally need more warning that 2 hours - and you and your fuxxing lawyer knows that!!! 

to Anders Wallerman

I will put the keys for you outside the door but don‚Äôt come in!!! 

from Anders Wallerman

There is no support for you by the law. 
But thats ok. I need all porsche keys. 


to Anders Wallerman

Good luck convincing ourself of that - I have a team waiting for you to make me take this to court. International court.

‚ûú Replying to you, 2022-07-06 12:36:19: ¬´ Good luck convincing ourself of that - I have a team waiting for you to make me take this to court. In... ¬ª

Well, i'm talking about access to the apartment. 
As long as I can get the keys today I won't bother getting in. But need All the keys.
You can also take a walk for 30 min..

to Anders Wallerman

The door is open - go get what you need and let me know when you are done!

from Anders Wallerman

Will do, i will arrive 13:15, will locate the keys and then leave the apartment. I will text

from Anders Wallerman

Done and left

to Anders Wallerman

Thanks for cancelling the gas card by the way. 

from Anders Wallerman

I havent.. 

to Anders Wallerman
from Anders Wallerman

Yet again.. i am not doing anything without informing.. 
erik might gave as he is trying to save FFP..


to Anders Wallerman

That‚Äôs a lie - you disappoint me. 

from Anders Wallerman

Whatever Katja.


from Anders Wallerman

You have your belief.. nothing i can do or say will change that.. 

to Anders Wallerman

Everything you have done - especially lately and leaving me in this position, knowing I have no money and now not even a gas card and expecting me to fix shit so we ALL - not just you  - can move on is harassment. You are also dating another woman - Maria Danell - and still you stall this settlement - it‚Äôs pathetic. 

from Anders Wallerman

Still not stalling.. Email Fredric and ask where he is. 
Yet again.. I have Not cancelled your card.. 
how many of these discussions are we going to have??
FFP is probably going bankcrupt..it's days from it unless the new funding is being closed.. 
Reach out to Erik

to Anders Wallerman

Frederick have not been on vacation for 2 months, has he? How come it‚Äôs been so hard for you to put down on a piece of paper what you know is between a us as requested? It took me less than a week - without a lawyer. 

Answer: you don‚Äôt want to because it will force you to act accordingly to all the (empty) promises and fake gifts you gave me over the years. So it‚Äôs easy for professionals to see that you are now playing games, you are lying to me and everyone around you and yet here you are, trying to play the victim. Good luck Anders - I never expected you to go this low.

from Anders Wallerman

You dictate your own truth. As always..
Why are you arguing with me? 
Haven't we agreed to let fredric be your contact? 


from Anders Wallerman

I will be back in the apartment w28 sunday

to Anders Wallerman

I‚Äôm expressing my opinion and also reminding you that giving me access to some of OUR money since I haven‚Äôt seen a salary for two months - would make things a little less complicated, right? But as documented, even tho you wrote this to me, you are not the man who will ‚Äúalways live up to his financial promises‚Äù. And speaking of returning to the apartment - my lawyer will request that I stay in the apartment until the legal document is signed as - now without a gas card - I literally have no chance to go anywhere. But you do, you have all the money and opportunities to do something else for you and your kids. Enjoy your summer and fall and winter - depending on how long you want to drag this out.

from Anders Wallerman

Ok. 
I'll let the landlords now that they can contact you directly so that you can take over the apartment. I move out

from Anders Wallerman

I'll

from Anders Wallerman

Know

to Anders Wallerman

I have not agreed to that. Officially hereby stated. Everything you do in regards to that is now legally on your account only.

to Anders Wallerman

But I will make note of that you yourself now have suggested to move out. I will let Mia know.

from Anders Wallerman

I don't understand.. You want to stay? I say that i'll move? 
I just told you.. 
i'll move.. you have your 2 weeks and then i'll get acess according to what you gave said that we have agreeed.. 


from Anders Wallerman

If you don't want the apartment.. we just end the contract

from Anders Wallerman

I will let them know about my personal resignation 

to Anders Wallerman

I do want the apartment but we will let the lawyers make all arrangements in regard to that and it will not take effect until the entire legal document is signed. As already planned - so don‚Äôt play games.

from Anders Wallerman

I am not playing games.. i'm ending my part of the contract.. and that is 3 months according to Bj√∂rn/Andreas. That has Absolutely nothing to do with you.. i am legally not obligated to do anything else towards the landlords and the apartment. 

to Anders Wallerman

Ok - I will make note of this to the lawyers.

to Anders Wallerman

I vacuumed this afternoon - found this bag in the cat toilet from your daughters party!

to Anders Wallerman
to Anders Wallerman

I‚Äôm not going to give you a hard time about it - just think you should know that hard drugs were involved last Saturday. I will leave it for you.

from Anders Wallerman

It could equally has been from one of your parties

to Anders Wallerman

Oh please 

to Anders Wallerman

I will happily drug test ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

from Anders Wallerman

I don't need any more communication with you today.. or ever.

to Anders Wallerman

But let‚Äôs not discuss this - I did not want to argue - I just wanted you to know 

from Anders Wallerman

Thank you

from Anders Wallerman

I will expect to have acess according to Your 2 weeks plan until we move, i will let you know as soon as i have the date for our new plaxe. No flex either way on the weeks. So our bext week is w29
Zemin is a complete dick when you sre not around and is beating up the other cats. What do you want to do about that? 
I will plan everything so it aligns with my weeks. Fyi.


from Anders Wallerman

Have you forbidden Molly to get her stuff in the apartment? 


from Anders Wallerman

I got your communication now so forget sbout the above.. she just told me that you had not let her in. But reading the message made it clear.
Is the windows closed aswell? She wants stuff before we take off

to Anders Wallerman

No - I have explained to her, like I already have to you, that Wednesday and Thursday this week was not an option for you guys to pick up stuff. I have plans - remember who‚Äôs birthday it is? 

I left early this morning, will return later - don‚Äôt know when yet - not leaving a key as I assumed that you did your business yesterday.

from Anders Wallerman

‚ûú Replying to you, 2022-07-07 14:10:04: ¬´ No - I have explained to her, like I already have to you, that Wednesday and Thursday this week was no... ¬ª

It was only Molly that wanted clothes.

Off course i remember zinas birhtday, i didn't expect you to want me to congratule her so I did not

to Anders Wallerman

Yes Zinas birthday - that I suddenly could not go to as planned  - thanks to Eric and you and no salary or gas card üéâ The list of shit this situation is creating for me alone, while ‚Äúwe‚Äù officially is trying to solve something, is getting insanely long. Too long

to Anders Wallerman

Do I have to mention I could not buy her a present this year? 

to Anders Wallerman

Oh wait - not your problem anymore. Enjoy your god damn weekend and when you have a moment - imagine what life would be like if I had taken the opportunity for you to do so, away from you because‚Ä¶ because why Anders? What is your reason for all this????  

to Anders Wallerman

Yeah exactly - no response, so don‚Äôt give me that pretending bullshit that you were ‚Äútrying to be considerate‚Äù towards Zina by not congratulate her on her birthday‚Ä¶. 

to Anders Wallerman

All this - while you took my car yesterday?  Noted and we are NOT being friendly and patient with each other any longer! 

You have just had two months to fix things between us without having to talk about the mental abuse you served me. That just stopped now - I‚Äôm taking you to court! All the way - and know that Tove Sander, Christina Bergenstein are together finding me a lawyer who had time to assist me this fall - Bergenstein would have taken my case was she not involved with the Swedbank and Bonnsen case. Good fuxxing kuck Anders - you think they would even consider taking me in if I I did not stand a chance winning this? 

I was giving you some more time to come around but this is definitely an end stop to that! 

Court is public - remember that!

to Anders Wallerman

And laugh all that you want‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ you are so overly brave and stupid it is beyond belief!! 

to Anders Wallerman

Thank good we can talk freely about throw case now!! 

to Anders Wallerman

And yes - you succeed in getting me pissed of but you actually also just proved what I told our current lawyers lady week days ago‚Ä¶. You don‚Äôt stop‚Ä¶. You move around like a predictable miserable mental case - and the last couple of days is brilliant proof of that - court worthy - combined with the past years! 

to Anders Wallerman

As your lawyer is not available so we can finish the property division, you can come by tonight and pick up yours and the kids personal belongings and only that. 

I can put a few moving boxes in the hall way - so it can be a quick in and out for you. I assume you will come at 19:00 and half an hour is enough for you. 

Please confirm that you have read my message and agree on the terms for tonight.

Or better yet, come by when the property division is legally agreed on and a plan for you moving out is made and approved by the both of us. 

My lawyer is informed about this text.

Katja
